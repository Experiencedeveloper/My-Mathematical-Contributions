## 1. Impilog Theorem (Imaginary Pi Logarithm Theorem)
$$\ln(-a) = \ln(a) + \pi i$$

### Abstract
The Impilog Theorem captures the relationship between the natural logarithm of a negative number and its positive counterpart in the complex plane. This theorem utilizes the properties of complex logarithms to extend the concept of logarithms to negative numbers.

### Detailed Explanation
In the realm of real numbers, the natural logarithm isn't defined for negative numbers. This is where imaginary numbers come into play. By extending the logarithm function to the complex plane, we can define the natural logarithm for negative numbers as well. The Impilog Theorem provides this extension by relating the natural logarithm of a negative number to its positive counterpart plus a complex term involving π. This theorem bridges the gap between real and complex logarithms, offering a more comprehensive understanding of logarithmic functions.

### Proof
By definition, the natural logarithm of a complex number \(z = re^{i\theta}\) (where \(r\) is the magnitude and \(\theta\) is the argument) is given by:
$$\ln(z) = \ln(r) + i\theta$$
For a negative real number \(-a\), its magnitude \(r = a\) and argument \(\theta = \pi\). Therefore,
$$\ln(-a) = \ln(a) + i\pi$$

### Potential Applications
- **Complex Analysis**: Useful in the study of complex numbers and functions.
- **Quantum Mechanics**: Assists in understanding wave functions and quantum phenomena involving complex numbers.
- **Signal Processing**: Valuable in analyzing signals represented by complex numbers.

## 2. Radical Cube Theorem
$$a\sqrt{a} = \sqrt{a^3}$$

### Abstract
The Radical Cube Theorem simplifies expressions involving radicals and powers by equating \(a\sqrt{a}\) to \(\sqrt{a^3}\). This theorem highlights the properties of exponents and radicals, offering a straightforward simplification.

### Detailed Explanation
This theorem demonstrates that the product of a number and its square root is equivalent to the square root of the number cubed. It utilizes the properties of exponents and radicals to simplify expressions, making algebraic manipulations more accessible.

### Proof
On the left-hand side,
$$a\sqrt{a} = a \cdot a^{1/2} = a^{1 + 1/2} = a^{3/2}$$
On the right-hand side,
$$\sqrt{a^3} = (a^3)^{1/2} = a^{3/2}$$
Thus, both sides are equal.

### Potential Applications
- **Algebraic Simplifications**: Assists in simplifying expressions involving radicals and powers.
- **Engineering Calculations**: Useful for simplifying calculations in various engineering fields.
- **Mathematical Modeling**: Simplifies models that involve exponentiation and radical expressions.

## 3. Square Root Division Theorem
$$\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{\sqrt{n}}{n}$$

### Abstract
The Square Root Division Theorem equates the reciprocal of the square root of \(n\) to the square root of \(n\) divided by \(n\). This theorem provides a useful simplification for expressions involving reciprocals and square roots.

### Detailed Explanation
This theorem demonstrates an equivalence that simplifies the manipulation of expressions involving square roots and reciprocals. It is particularly useful in algebraic manipulations and calculus.

### Proof
On the left-hand side,
$$\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{1}{n^{1/2}} = n^{-1/2}$$
On the right-hand side,
$$\frac{\sqrt{n}}{n} = \frac{n^{1/2}}{n} = n^{1/2 - 1} = n^{-1/2}$$
Thus, both sides are equal.

### Potential Applications
- **Algebraic Manipulations**: Simplifies expressions and equations involving reciprocals and square roots.
- **Calculus**: Useful in integration and differentiation.
- **Physics and Engineering**: Simplifies equations in fields such as wave mechanics and electrical circuits.

## 4. Geometric Algorithm for π
$$\pi = 4 \int_{0}^{1} \sqrt{1-x^2} \, dx$$

### Abstract
This geometric formula for π is based on integrating the function \( \sqrt{1-x^2} \) from 0 to 1, representing a quarter-circle of radius 1. By integrating over this interval and multiplying by 4, we obtain the area of the entire unit circle, which is π.

### Detailed Explanation
This formula provides a geometric approach to calculating π by relating it to the area of a circle. The integrand \( \sqrt{1-x^2} \) represents the equation of a quarter-circle, and integrating it over the interval from 0 to 1 yields the area of that quarter-circle. Multiplying by 4 gives us the area of the full circle, which is π.

### Proof
The area of a circle of radius \(r\) is given by \( \pi r^2 \). For a unit circle (\(r = 1\)), the area is π. The function \( \sqrt{1-x^2} \) represents the upper half of the unit circle. Integrating this function from 0 to 1 gives us the area of a quarter of the circle:
$$ \int_{0}^{1} \sqrt{1-x^2} \, dx $$
Multiplying by 4 gives the total area, which is π.

### Potential Applications

- **Computational Mathematics**: Basis for numerical algorithms to approximate the value of π.
- **Geometry and Trigonometry**: Provides a geometric perspective on the value of π, aiding in teaching and understanding these subjects.# My Mathematical Contributions
